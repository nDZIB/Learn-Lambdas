There couldn't be a better day
Of all the days You give me grace to see on the earth's face,
there couldn't be a better day than this.
You make each day so special: such that i wonder how the next would be
there couldn't be a better day than this i keep saying
After the day's toilings, after remembering the slim escapes,
there couldn't be a better day i say.
But among good days, there are the days beyond the scope of good
Days when you regulate my watch and customize my time and moves
Days when you guide my steps and speed most precisely.
On some days, coincidence could attempt to provide reasons
But on these, there is completely no logical explanation possible
How you could bring me in just on time
Take me out just to enter on time
All in a row and with no losses.
On such, you make me see deeper, beyond what i think i am
Lord, you open my eyes to hidden paths and corners
Making me shout: "lost but found"
The strength i feel when i lay in bed drives away sleep
I become so excited about how sweet life could be that,
I change my wish to: couldn't this day become unending?
Lord each day, i pray for an increasing measure of your love
Lord each day you spare me to see, i plead your special sustainance.
Father, if i can contribute to making the more than good days re-surface,
Open my eyes to see what i can do.
But so far, i have been contributing nothing:
So i know it is on you:
Let it be Lord, But i pray to keep saying: there couldn't be a better day
